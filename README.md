Some cli scripts to interact with chatbots and other ai tools.

It depends on the following external tools:

- `eza`: To get informations about the file tree
- `ripgrep`: To search the filesystem for text

You can install the project via:

```sh
pip install -e .
```

or (if you have just installed)

```sh
just install
```
